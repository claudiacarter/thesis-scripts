# Introduction
This repository contains scripts I have written for my thesis 'Changes in the host transcriptome and epitranscriptome in response to *Strongyloides ratti* infection'. Aside from the command line code, which is detailed in my thesis Methods section, all scripts necessary to reproduce my work are included here.
